## The aim of the project is to help establish a site by which users can keep track of any changes on the site and will be notified about the same.

I believe this can be helpful for sites that lack the notification functionality as well as government sites which people frequent during the day in order to wait for announcements.

An albeit crude solution to the constant refreshing of the page, I aim to make the project very easy to use.
